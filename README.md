# Protolib

Often when prototyping I need to install a library run into dependency issues (old libs or just conflicts with common ML libs). 

This library has no dependencies, so no depedency issues.

## Summary

This library has standard Python implementations of different tools I use semi-frequently that are hard to to find, or otherwise difficult to install.

Is it fast? No
Is it complete? No
Is it reliable? Ehhh somewhat
Is it simple to use? Yes
